### New Features in HTML5

HTML5 introduced a wide range of new features and improvements over its predecessors, including:

1. **New Semantic Elements**: These elements define the structure of a document more clearly.
    - `<article>`
    - `<section>`
    - `<header>`
    - `<footer>`
    - `<nav>`
    - `<aside>`

2. **Form Enhancements**: Improved input types and attributes.
    - New input types: `email`, `date`, `number`, `url`, `range`, `search`
    - New attributes: `autocomplete`, `autofocus`, `placeholder`, `required`, `pattern`

3. **Graphics and Multimedia**:
    - `<canvas>` element for drawing graphics on the fly via scripting (e.g., JavaScript).
    - `<audio>` and `<video>` elements for embedding media content.

4. **APIs and DOM Enhancements**:
    - Offline web applications: Application Cache API
    - Web Storage: `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
    - Geolocation API
    - Drag and Drop API
    - Web Workers for background processing
    - Server-sent events and WebSockets for real-time communication

5. **Improved Markup and Scripting**:
    - Deprecated certain elements (e.g., `<font>`, `<center>`, `<big>`, `<strike>`)
    - Integrated support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) and MathML for mathematical markup.
    - Enhanced scripting capabilities with the `async` and `defer` attributes for the `<script>` tag.

### What Are Semantic Tags?

Semantic tags clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way, making the structure of web pages more understandable.

#### Examples of Semantic Tags

1. **`<article>`**: Represents a self-contained composition that can be independently distributed or reused.
   ```html
   <article>
     <h2>Title of the Article</h2>
     <p>This is a paragraph within the article.</p>
   </article>
   ```

2. **`<nav>`**: Represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.
   ```html
   <nav>
     <ul>
       <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
       <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
     </ul>
   </nav>
   ```

### Uses of Semantic Tags

1. **Improved Accessibility**: Semantic tags help screen readers and assistive technologies better understand the structure and content of a webpage, providing a better experience for users with disabilities.

2. **Better SEO**: Search engines can more effectively index and understand the content of a webpage, improving search engine optimization (SEO) and potentially ranking.

3. **Easier Maintenance**: Developers can more easily read and maintain the code. Understanding the structure and purpose of different parts of a webpage becomes simpler with meaningful tags.

4. **Consistent Styling**: Semantic tags allow for more consistent and easier-to-manage styling with CSS. For instance, applying styles to all `<nav>` elements across a site can be done easily.

5. **Improved Collaboration**: With a clearer structure, teams can collaborate more efficiently. Developers, designers, and content creators can understand the purpose of each section without needing detailed explanations.

Using semantic tags in HTML5 enhances both the functionality and accessibility of web pages, leading to a more robust and user-friendly web.
